<h2>Explanation of the Animal Clinic Website</h2>
<p>I've created a complete animal clinic website using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with smooth animations throughout. The website includes:</p>
<span>1. Animated Introduction Sequence: When the site loads, users see an animated sequence showing the clinic's logo and name with smooth transitions.</span>
<br>
<span>2. Interactive Navigation: The navigation menu features hover effects and an animated mobile menu for smaller screens.</span>
<br>
<span>3. Service Cards with Animations: Each service card has hover animations and bouncing icons for visual feedback.</span>
<br>
<span>4. Animated Appointment Calendar: The appointment booking system includes a multi-step process with smooth transitions between steps and an interactive calendar interface</span>
<br>
<span>5. Scroll Animations: Elements animate into view as the user scrolls down the page, creating an engaging experience.</span>
<br>
<span>6. Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and ensures animations work correctly across all device sizes.</span>
<h2>Key Animation Features:</h2>
<li>CSS Animations: Used for transitions, hover effects, and the intro sequence</li>
<li>JavaScript Animations: For more complex interactions and dynamic content</li>
<li>Intersection Observer API: To trigger animations when elements come into view</li>
<li>Smooth Transitions: Between different sections and appointment booking steps</li>
<br>
<span>The website structure includes:</span>
<li>Home page with animated intro and service previews</li>
<li>Services page with detailed service information</li>
<li>Appointment booking page with interactive calendar</li>
<li>About and Contact pages (referenced in navigation)</li>
<br>
<p>All animations are designed to enhance the user experience without being distracting, with subtle hover effects on buttons and interactive elements throughout the site.</p>
